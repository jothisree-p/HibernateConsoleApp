Water Utility Billing & Meter Reading Management System (Hibernate)

Project Description:
The Water Utility Billing & Meter Reading Management System is a console-based Java application developed using Hibernate ORM Framework to automate water consumer management, meter reading records, 
and monthly bill generation. The system ensures data accuracy, transactional integrity, and rule-based billing using Hibernate’s object-relational mapping and transaction management features.
It replaces manual billing processes used by water utility departments with an efficient and reliable automated solution.
Hibernate simplifies database interaction by mapping Java classes to database tables and eliminating the need for manual SQL queries, improving maintainability and scalability

Objectives:
Manage water consumers efficiently using Hibernate entity management
Record monthly meter readings without duplication using Hibernate persistence
Generate accurate water bills based on water consumption
Maintain outstanding balances automatically
Support bill cancellation with balance restoration using Hibernate transactions
Ensure database consistency using Hibernate transaction management
Reduce manual SQL operations using Hibernate ORM

Technologies Used:
Java (Core Java)
Hibernate ORM Framework
Hibernate Configuration (hibernate.cfg.xml)
JPA Annotations (@Entity, @Table, @Id, etc.)
DAO Design Pattern
Console-based User Interface

Key Features:
Consumer Management (Add, View, Update Consumers)
Meter Reading Management (Monthly readings with validation)
Automatic Bill Generation based on usage
Outstanding Balance Tracking
Bill Cancellation with automatic balance adjustment
Transaction management using Hibernate Session and Transaction
Object-Relational Mapping using Hibernate Entities
